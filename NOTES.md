# Introduction 
The purpose of this project was to create a MVP using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I created an application that would mimic a dating app so that users can "like" images and plan a trip with a form. 

# Requirements
This assignment  required that I run the app on a single page as well as incorporate 3 separate event listners. The event listeners I used were DOMContent loaded, click and submit.
